PROBLEM:-
	This is a python proram.
A string of uppercase English letters is repeated k times
count a specific english letter in the first N characters 
in the final string.

DESCRIPTION:-
*Firstly no of testcases required .
*Enter the string and repeated it k times,then the final string as
	abdabdabdabd..........(k times)
*Select the required character in the string.
*Count the required character upto n characters in the final string.
*Let suppose required character is 'b'upto 8 characters
	abdabdab\dabdabd.......(k times)
	n=8    count=3
*Finally print the count of required character in the final string 
 upto N characters....

PROGRAM:-
t=int(input('no of testcases':))
for i in range(t):
	s=input('Enter string:')
	k=int(input('Repeat string k times:'))
	char=input('select required character:')
	N=int(input('Required first N characters :'))
	c1=0
	c2=0
	c=0
	x=N//len(s)
	r=N%len(s)
	for j in range(len(s)):
		if char==s[j]:
			c1+=1
	c=x*c1
	for z in range(r):
		if char==s[z]:
			c2+=1
	c=c+c2
	print('count of required character in first N characters:',int(c))

INPUT:-
no .of testcases:1
Enter string:ABD
Repeat string k times:4
Select required character:B
Required first N characters:8

OUTPUT:-
count of required character in first N characters:3

INPUT EXPLANATION:-
First line of input contains a testcases of the string.
entering the string 
repeating string k times
selecting character in the orginal string
count the character in first N characters of the final string.

OUTPUT EXPLANATION:-
print the count of the required character in first N  characters..

TIME COMPLEXITY:-
Time complexity of this program is in the order of O(len(s)).
