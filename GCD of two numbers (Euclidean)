PROBLEM:-
	This is a python progam.
Finding the GCD of the two number using Euclidean method..

DESCRIPTION:-
*Take two integers numbers as input.
*Find the larger and smaller integer in both of them.
*Now divide larger with smaller until remainders becomes zero.
*When remainder becomes zero ,then print smaller integer in the 
 recursion as final anwser of GCD of the two numbers.

PROGRAM:-
n1=int(input('Enter first number:'))
n2=int(input('Enter second number:'))
if n1>n2:
	l=n1
	s=n2
else:
	l=n2
	s=n1
def gcd(l,s):
	if l%s==0:
		return s
	return gcd(s,l%s)
print(f'GCD of two numbers {n1} and{n2} is:',gcd(n1,n2))

INPUT:_
Enter first number:10
Enter second number:15

OUTPUT:-
GCD of two numbers {10} and {15} is:5

TIME COMPLEXITY:-
Time complexity of this program GCD of two number is in the order of O(  ).
